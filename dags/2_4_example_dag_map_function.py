"""Example DAG showing the use of the .map method.
This DAG shows an example implementation of dynamically mapping over an
S3DeleteObjectsOperator and skipping deletion of certain files based on their
filetype using a .map mapping. This type of mapping was added in Airflow 2.4.

The first task 'list_files_S3' lists all files in S3_BUCKET. Instead of passing
the input directly to the deletion task a mapping step is used in between,
using the map_files_for_deletion function. This function will not create an
Airflow task.
map_files_for_deletion maps all files of the type json, yml and txt to an
Airflow exception causing these files to be skipped in the deletion task.

The delete_files task is dynamically mapped over the transformed list of files.
